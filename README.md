# Simple Calculator in Python

A beginner-friendly calculator built using Python, developed during my internship at **CodSoft**. This project performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — based on user input.

## Features

- Prompts the user to input two numbers
- Lets the user choose an operation: +, -, *, /
- Handles division by zero
- Returns and displays the final result
- Includes input validation and friendly prompts

## What I Learned

This project helped me:
- Practice Python basics like `input()`, `if-elif`, and `float()` conversion
- Handle edge cases like invalid input and zero division
- Write clean and readable CLI (Command Line Interface) programs
- Build real-world logic with simple structures
